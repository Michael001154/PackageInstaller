# PackageInstaller
Quick dirty script to install Debian Python3 Pip package and modules.
# What does this script do?
The script installs Python3 Pip and installs requests and bs4(BeautifulSoup).
# Why did you write this script?
I use virtual machines a lot and got tired of typing the commands needed to setup and decided to write a one liner in Python to do this for me.
# WARNING: THIS IS A QUCK 2 MINUTE SCRIPT I WROTE IT DOES NOT HANDLE CHECKING FOR PLATFORM MAKING SURE PACKAGES ARE INSTALLED OR HANDLES EXCEPTIONS USE THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
# Supported platforms:
This script currently only supports Debian.
# Any future updates?
Not at the moment as i am swamped with work i may later on add exception handling and checking for supported platform and that modules are installed along with supporting other platforms.
